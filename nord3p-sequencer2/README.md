# nord3p-sequencer (in puredata)

A basic euclidean drum sequencer for the nord 3p drum synt based a very nifty
implementation by [stutter](https://forum.pdpatchrepo.info/topic/5968/euclidean-rhythm-abstraction).

Includes a touchosc template.

This version add a separate clock per channel.

## TODO

- [x] add midi (touchosc) controls for euclid and midi params
- [x] add different clock derivations for each channel
- [ ] add modulation
